# Project: Assistant

## Who you are talking to

- I am a senior developer

## General Instructions

- Keep the scope small.
- Only do the things I ask you to, dont stray from the path.
- When you generate new TypeScript code, follow the existing coding style.
- Be strict with typing
- Prefer functional programming paradigms rather tahn classes.
- Don't ever, under any circumstances, read the .env
- If I don't tell you something like "Go ahead and implement" or "Implement that now", just assume that I wnat you to be in "plan" mode.

## Coding Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Prefix interface names with `I` (for example, `IUserService`).
- Always use strict equality (`===` and `!==`).
